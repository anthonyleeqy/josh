# josh

Josh is the crypto-trading robot ðŸ¤– I created thanks to #Freqtrade (https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/) open source framework. 

By deploying Josh to a cloud service (AWS, Digital Ocean), he can work for me 24/7 and trade according to market signal (he is so hardworking!). 

How to wake Josh up?

**1. Start**

   To start off docker image 
```
cd /Users/~/freqtrade/

docker-compose up -d
```
<br/>

**2. Data Downloading**

   I personally use Binance US data.
```
docker-compose run freqtrade download-data --exchange binanceus -t 15m
```
<br/>

**3. Backtesting**

   Back test if all the hyperparameters are working well to serve the puspose of maximizing profit.

   **change to static pair list "method": "StaticPairList" in config.json file
```
docker-compose run freqtrade backtesting -s ADXMomentum
```
<br/>

**4. Hyperparameter Tuning**

   **change to static pair list "method": "StaticPairList"
   
   **can later move back to VolumePairList
   
```
docker-compose run freqtrade hyperopt --hyperopt-loss SharpeHyperOptLossDaily --strategy ADXMomentumHopt -e 1500
```

<br/>

**5. Data Analysis**

   Stop the container first, docker compose down.
   
   Open Jupiter notebook in browser using popped up url.
   
   Upload config.json and strategy file to the same directory as popped up Jupiter notebook.
   
```
cd /Users/~/freqtrade

docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-jupyter.yml up
```
<br/>

**6. File Transfer**

   Use FileZilla to transfer configuration file to virtual machine or cloud.
<br/>


**7. Trading Results Analysis**

   From time to time, use the strategy_analysis.ipynb file to analyze and visualize trading results. Strategy needs constant update and analysis based on market conditions.
